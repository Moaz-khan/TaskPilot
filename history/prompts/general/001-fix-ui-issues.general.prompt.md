# Fix UI Issues

## Prompt Text
/sp.implement

You are working on the **TaskPilot Todo App**.

Some UI fixes are still **incorrect or incomplete**, and some loaders are **hurting user experience**.

Your task is to **ONLY fix and clean up the issues listed below**.

❗ Do **NOT** change anything outside this scope.

## ✅ REQUIRED FIXES (MANDATORY)

### 1️⃣ HOME PAGE CTA BUTTON (CRITICAL)

* The **CTA button on the Home page does NOT match** the rest of the app buttons.
* Fix it to **EXACTLY match**:

  * Dashboard buttons
  * Login / Signup buttons
* Use the **same Button component**, same:

  * padding
  * font size
  * border radius
  * hover animation
  * light & dark theme behavior

---

### 2️⃣ FOOTER SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS

* Footer social media icons:

  * ❌ not centered
  * ❌ no hover effect
* Fix:

  * Align icons **perfectly center**
  * Add **professional hover effects**
  * Smooth transitions
  * Ensure hover works in **light & dark mode**

---

### 3️⃣ DASHBOARD RESPONSIVENESS (BROKEN)

* Dashboard is **NOT responsive** like other pages.
* Fix responsiveness for:

  * Mobile
  * Tablet
  * Laptop
* Match responsiveness level of:

  * Home page
  * Login
  * Signup
* ❗ No redesign — responsiveness only.

---

### 4️⃣ GLOBAL INITIAL LOADER (MISSING)

* On **first website load**, no loader is shown.
* Fix:

  * Add **one clean full-screen initial loader**
  * Loader must appear **only once** when app starts
  * Remove any duplicate startup loaders

---

### 5️⃣ PAGE LOADERS – VISIBILITY & CLEANUP

* Existing loaders:

  * ❌ not centered
  * ❌ overflow / partially hidden
* Fix:

  * Proper center alignment
  * Correct z-index
  * Full visibility on all screen sizes

---

### 6️⃣ ❌ REMOVE UNNECESSARY LOADERS (UX ISSUE)

Some loaders **damage user experience** and must be removed.

* Remove loaders from:

  * ➤ **Add Task action**
  * ➤ Any instant UI action where delay is negligible
* Rule:

  * ❌ No loader for fast local actions
  * ✅ Loader ONLY where there is real async waiting (page load, auth, data fetch)
* Keep UX **fast and clean**, not noisy.

---

### 7️⃣ NOTIFICATION SYSTEM (NOT PROFESSIONAL)

* Notifications look basic.
* Improve to **professional UI**:

  * Clean spacing
  * Clear typography
  * Smooth enter / exit animation
  * Proper success / error styling
* ❗ Logic stays same — UI only.

---

### 8️⃣ DASHBOARD NAVBAR TEXT (DARK MODE BUG)

* In Dashboard navbar:

  * "Task" text is not readable in dark mode
* Fix:

  * Make it **pure white** in dark theme
  * Ensure proper contrast

---

### 9️⃣ HOME PAGE THEME BUTTON RESPONSIVENESS

* Theme toggle button on Home page:

  * ❌ not following navbar responsive behavior
* Fix:

  * When navbar collapses, theme button must:

    * Hide / move consistently
    * Appear inside responsive menu if needed

---

### 🔟 DARK MODE HOVER EFFECTS (MISSING)

* Hover effects do not work properly in dark mode.
* Fix:

  * Enable hover styles in **dark theme**
  * Especially on:

    * Dashboard buttons
    * Cards
    * Interactive elements

---

## 🚫 STRICT RULES

* ❌ No backend changes
* ❌ No new features
* ❌ No redesign
* ❌ No unnecessary loaders
* ❌ No scope creep
* ✅ Fix ONLY what is listed

---

## 🎯 GOAL

Deliver a **clean, fast, professional UX**
with:

* Consistent buttons
* Proper dark mode
* Responsive dashboard
* Minimal & meaningful loaders

If any listed item cannot be fully fixed, **explicitly mention which one and why**.
